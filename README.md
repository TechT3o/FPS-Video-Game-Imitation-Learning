# Video-games-target-generalization

We are addressing the problem of training an agent how to perform a task. Usually such models need a large amount of data and leghty and computationally intensive training. In this project we first collect data of a human playing the sphere clash game mode of 3D aim trainer. Then, a recurrent convolutional neural network is built and trained on these data to learn how to shoot the targets. After, Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) can be done to collect more data to improve the agent's performance. Finally, few data of the agent playing the tile frenzy game mode are collected and the agent is fine tuned on these data to learn how to play the tile frenzy game mode effectively generalizing to a new environment.

## Data collection

For the data collection [mouse_logger.py](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/data_recording/mouse_input.py) was created to record the mouse movement and whether the left click was pushed (shot or not). Frames from the computer screen are obtained by the get_image function in the [environment_axtraction.py](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/data_recording/environment_extraction.py). The mouse motion for every frame as well as the frame image path are recorded in a .csv file for every frame in [data_recording.py](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/data_recording/data_recording.py). To record data you must run [data_recording_main.py](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/data_recording_main.py) and set the save path and whether the first person shooter playing resets the game cursor in every frame which can be found by using the [mouse log test](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/data_recording/mouse_input.py#L143-L153) function

## Agent training

The option to build different types of models such as models with different bases, with LSTM layer or not and with or without the game features chain is written in [model_building.py](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/agent_training/model_building.py). The data from the csvs are loaded and encoded appropriately to be fed in the neural network by [data_normalizing.py](https://github.com/TechT3o/Video-games-target-generalization/blob/main/agent_training/data_normalizing.py).
